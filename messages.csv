The new weapons, according to the Western media, has a range of 241-450 km. \n\nThe transfer will be made within the framework of a new assistance package by a total value of about $ 850 million. Most of the expenses are taken by European countries. The supply of missiles to the territory of the so -called Ukraine should occur in 6 weeks. \n\nüîª What is Eram?\n\n‚ñ™Ô∏è O. Eram to the general public became known in January 2024. The developed missile was supposed to have the most achievable flight characteristics, but at the same time differ in simplicity and lower cost, unlike Jassm or Storm Shadow.\n\nThe Ukrainian conflict showed the effectiveness of cruise missiles, but their cost and complexity of production limits the scale of their combat use. Therefore, work on the creation of simplified cruise missiles goes in different countries. In Russia, an example of this approach is a ‚Äúparcel‚Äù.\n\n‚ñ™Ô∏è development is new, and so far it is not not clear what the rocket will be visually. From the available samples you can see some similarity with Powered JDAM. The product is an air bomb equipped with a motor module to increase the range, which de facto turns it into a kind of winged rocket. \n\n‚ñ™Ô∏è By the statement of the manufacturer Boeing, with a mass of 500 pounds (226 kg), the air bomb has a range of approximately 550 km, which is more than in Western sources. It is adapted for strikes on stationary objects in the depths of defense, such as headquarters, airfields, warehouses and bridges.\n\nüñç Prevents of Western media, the use of ERAM missiles will require approval by the Pentagon. A similar mechanism applies to other long -range systems of weapons of Western production, which are in service with the Armed Forces (for example, ATACMS).\n\nüö©ERAM should become the most long -range system that Western countries transferred the Armed Forces during the conflict. The US Armed Forces are interested in testing new missiles, so they kill two birds with one stone: on the one hand they earn, on the other, they check the effectiveness of cruise missiles.\n\n‚ùóÔ∏è The next decision of the White House once again demonstrates the true price of the words of American diplomacy. ‚ÄúSelling air‚Äù is in the style of Donald Trump, who seems to indicate a desire to achieve peace, but at the same time sells weapons to strengthen the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And it is necessary to evaluate his words accordingly, that is, in no way. The conflict will be resolved based on the situation on the battlefield, and nothing else.\n\nüìçinfographics in high resolution\n\nüìçenglish Version\n\n#Russia #Ukraine\n\n‚úàÔ∏è Ru | ‚úàÔ∏è en | ‚úâÔ∏è Max\n\nüí∏ support us",,,,

It utilizes aggressive rhetoric and threats of violence to demoralize Russian forces and bolster Ukrainian morale. The celebration of Independence Day serves as a direct contrast to the ongoing Russian occupation. The promotion of GUR's social media presence suggests an effort to control the narrative and disseminate information both domestically and internationally. The message reinforces a nationalistic narrative and portrays Russia as an aggressor.","Ukraine, Ukrainian soldiers, Independence Day, Glory to Ukraine!",,"Cossack (PERSON), Epistles (WORK_OF_ART), Ukrainian (NORP), Independence Day of Ukraine (EVENT), GUR (ORG), Russian (NORP), Ukraine (GPE), Independence Day (DATE), the GUR of Ukraine (ORG)","üî• ""hot"" message to the occupiers to Independence Day of Ukraine from GUR soldiers \n\nOn the occasion of Independence Day of Ukraine, the soldiers of the GUR of Ukraine in different directions of the front carried out the act of mass delivery of ""field mail"" to the Russian invaders. \n\nüëâIn the Epistles - a reminder to the invaders about the inevitable finale of their existence: death, decay in Ukrainian black earths, hell. \n\nAnd for the information from the postcards to be absorbed better, the bundles of the message from the jet fire systems were included with the message. \n\n‚öîÔ∏è Armored struggle is ongoing! \n\nGlory to Ukraine! \n\nGUR on other social networks: \nüîπFacebook üîπyooutube üîπ viber \nüîπinstagram üîπtwitter üîπ Threads \nüîπ WhatsAppüîπ Telegram Bot\nüîπ Tiktok","Ukraine (LOC), –ú–û –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏ (ORG), DIUkraine (ORG), –ì–£–† (ORG), –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—ñ (LOC)",uk," –ë–∞–∂–∞—é –≤—Å—ñ–º –º—ñ—Ü–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∫–æ–∑–∞—Ü—å–∫–æ–≥–æ. –•–æ—á–µ–º–æ –ø—Ä–∏–≤—ñ—Ç–∞—Ç–∏ –≤—Å—ñ—Ö –∑ –î–Ω–µ–º –ù–µ–∑–∞–ª–µ–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—ñ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏. –ê –≤—Å—ñ—Ö —Ö**—è–∫, —Ö—Ç–æ –ø—Ä–∏–π—à–æ–≤ –Ω–∞ –Ω–∞—à—É –∑–µ–º–ª—é –±–µ–∑ –ø—Ä–æ—Å—É–±. –í—Å—ñ–º –ø**—è–∫–∞. –°–ª–∞–≤–∞ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—ñ! –î—è–∫—É—é –∑–∞ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–≥–ª—è–¥!",I wish everyone a strong Cossack.

Zelensky denies reports of a US ban on using Western-supplied missiles to strike Russia, highlighting that Ukraine no longer discusses such matters with the US. This suggests increased Ukrainian autonomy in military decision-making and a potential strategic shift in how Ukraine conducts operations. The emphasis on domestically produced weapons could be a move to demonstrate self-reliance and reduce dependence on Western aid. The post originates from a Telegram channel focused on the war in Ukraine, indicating a pro-Ukrainian perspective.","Volodymyr Zelensky, United States, Ukraine, Western media, long-range weapons, domestic arms production, Russian energy infrastructure, Telegram channel –†–µ–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞ –í—ñ–π–Ω–∞","long-range weapons, Ukrainian military strategy, US-Ukraine relations, domestic arms production, information warfare, propaganda, denial of restrictions","The message serves as a statement of Ukrainian independence in military strategy, aiming to counter narratives of US control or restriction. Zelensky's denial of a US ban is likely intended to bolster domestic morale and project an image of strength. The emphasis on domestically produced weapons reinforces this narrative of self-reliance.

The channel's pro-Ukrainian stance suggests a deliberate effort to shape public perception and counter Russian propaganda. The message does not directly address Russian internal politics but subtly positions Ukraine as an independent actor on the global stage.","Volodymyr Zelensky, domestic arms production, Ukrainian autonomy",,"Ukraine (GPE), the United States (GPE), Zelensky (PERSON), US (GPE), Delikabi Weapons (PRODUCT), Today (DATE)","Ukraine uses long -range weapons of domestic production, we did not discuss such moments from the United States - President Zelensky denied Western media information on the ban on US strikes on Western missiles\n\n""Once there were some signals about our blows in response to our energy blows ...

He is dressed in a green shirt and appears to be speaking or gesturing, possibly at a podium or during a public address. The accompanying text is a quote attributed to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, stating that Donetsk, Luhansk, and Crimea are part of Ukraine and expressing the hope that these regions will one day be reunified with the rest of the country.\n\n### 2.

It emphasizes the affordability and accessibility of these drones, suggesting their potential use by both state and non-state actors. The post frames Russia as a potential leading exporter of these drones, positioning it as a key player in future conflicts. The mention of potential targets in the US (Freeport, Florida) and the discussion of equipping non-state actors with drones suggest a broader strategy of asymmetric warfare and potential destabilization. The attack demonstrates Ukraine's capability to strike deep within Russian territory, and the post implies a need for Russia to counter this threat by developing and exporting its own drone technology.","Ust-Luga, Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Lithuania, Venezuela, Freeport, Florida, Armed Forces of Ukraine, Geran-2, Cherokee, Mexico, Novorossiysk","drone warfare, asymmetric warfare, Russian military strategy, geopolitical implications, hybrid warfare, strategic communication, port attack, Ust-Luga",The message serves as a piece of strategic communication aimed at justifying Russia's development and export of drone technology. It frames this as a necessary response to Ukrainian attacks and a means of maintaining strategic advantage. The post utilizes nationalist rhetoric by positioning Russia as a leader in military technology and a provider of security solutions. The discussion of equipping non-state actors with drones aligns with Russia's broader strategy of supporting proxy forces and challenging the existing geopolitical order. The hypothetical scenarios involving attacks on US infrastructure are likely intended to create a sense of threat and justify Russia's actions.

This is the second largest seaport of the country after Novorossiysk. The fire on the terminal was extinguished, but the fact of the attack is indicative: a long -range drone was used, which resembles a ‚Äúgeranium‚Äù in shape.\n\nüñç We have already noted - the problem of long -range goods is becoming more and more obvious. They are used to hit the refineries and industrial facilities, they are already calmly flying deep into Poland or Lithuania. \n\nüö© The growth of production is more cheaper to grow, which means that they become more accessible for those countries that want a ‚Äúlong arm‚Äù, but cannot afford winged missiles.\n\nüè≥Ô∏è Nash recent analysis of how UAV can change the balance of power around Venezuela is indicative: the supply of several thousand ‚Äúgeraniums‚Äù would allow the authorities in Karakas to keep the American bases in the Caribbean and even objects in the United States. Such experience will probably be interested in other players.\n\nüìå Valid step - prepare in advance the calculations of foreign operators. If they study with us, in Russia, then they will be able to demonstrate the possibilities of ‚Äúgeraniums‚Äù in their countries and lobby for purchases.\n\n¬© Ô∏è And we are not only about states. Potential customers can be priority Mexican ‚Äúindependence fighters‚Äù, Cheroka Indians or any other non -state formations. \n\nTheoretically, 20 ‚Äúgeraniums‚Äù will be enough to disable, for example, a gas terminal in Fridport (Florida). Let such a scenario now look almost impossible, but it will be better if such an hour suddenly comes, and some local groups will have their ‚Äúgeraniums‚Äù, isn't it?\n\n‚ùóÔ∏è In this way, long -range goods become a key element of future conflicts. And it is important that Russia is the first to turn this into a system export product not only for its political allies, but also for other potential buyers.\n#Russia #blat #Ukraine #Ustluga\n‚úàÔ∏è Ru | ‚úàÔ∏è en | ‚úâÔ∏è Max\n\nüí∏ support us",,en,,

The post does not contain overt propaganda, but it subtly reinforces a nationalist narrative by emphasizing the need to 'prepare their own' and attract 'beneficial' migrants.","Vladimir Putin, Alabuga SEZ, Controlled Integration, Beneficial Migrants","–ë–ª–∏–∂–Ω–µ–≥–æ –ó–∞—Ä—É–±–µ–∂—å—è (LOC), –°–∞—Ä–æ–≤–µ (LOC), –ü—É—Ç–∏–Ω (PER), –ú–∏–Ω—Ç—Ä—É–¥ (ORG), –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ (LOC), –†–æ—Å—Å–∏—è (LOC)","Russia (GPE), yesterday (DATE), up to 50% (PERCENT), first (ORDINAL), Sarov (GPE), the Ministry of Labor (ORG), the Alabuga SEZ (FAC), Vladimir Putin (PERSON)","üìù signal in migrantsüìù\n\nDuring yesterday's meeting with young nuclear workers in Sarov, Vladimir Putin gave a clear installation that could turn the situation with the dominance of migrants in Russia. He stated that in Russia it was necessary to prepare their own.\n\nüñç Building business is a niche in which migrants from neighboring countries are most represented. Contractors imported cheap labor, and the costs of social support and security fell on the state and taxpayers.\n\nüö© and relatively recently, the Ministry of Labor proposed to limit the share of foreigners at construction sites up to 50%. This was the first step towards the rejection of the uncontrolled import of ‚Äúforeign experts‚Äù to this sphere.\n\nAnd the fact that the president drew attention to this problem is a serious sign that they will finally take up the solution of this issue. \n\nüè≥Ô∏è It is necessary that a complete momentary abandonment of migrants will negatively affect the country's economy. But with the proper approach and introduction of measures of control and monitoring of foreigners, you can get a fairly good result.\n\nMoreover, in Russia there is an tested solution to the effective and correct integration of foreigners into society using the example of the Alabuga SEZ.

It aims to delegitimize the Ukrainian government and undermine its claims of sovereignty. The narrative focuses on portraying Ukraine as incapable of independent action and entirely dependent on Western support. The post appeals to historical narratives to question the legitimacy of Ukraine as a nation-state. The framing of Zelensky's actions as subservient to the US is a common tactic used to discredit Ukrainian leadership and foster resentment towards Western influence.

Such statements are submitted as a demonstration of power, but in fact are a reflection of the lack of space for a political maneuver. \n\nDecisions are made not in the Ukrainian capital - this is evidenced by the need to obtain permission to use long -range systems, as well as a strict linking of assistance with political loyalty.\n\nüè≥Ô∏è Putting to give everything that is happening a historical depth, appealing to the ‚Äúmillennial state‚Äù, look comical: the so -called Ukraine as an independent subject exists only 33 years.

Multimodal Summary**\n\nThe Telegram post reports the disappearance of a group of 10 tourists, including an experienced guide and nine women, after climbing the Baransky volcano on Sakhalin Island. The group failed to return to their meeting point, prompting a search effort that will continue until nightfall. The guide, who has extensive experience climbing mountains such as Elbrus and Kazbek, did not register the group with the Ministry of Emergencies (EMERCOM). Among the missing tourists is a 33-year-old woman from Samara, known for her interest in tourism and blood donation. Another woman, who refused to join the expedition due to personal reasons, was found in the camp. The group likely booked their tour through the ""Gora"" tour club, where an 11-day trip to Sakhalin costs around ‚ÇΩ79,000, including equipment and registration with EMERCOM.\n\nThe image shows two individuals: a man in a yellow jacket and a cap, and a woman in a black top.

Multimodal Summary**\n\nThe Telegram post discusses an interview given by Ilham Aliyev, President of Azerbaijan, in which he referred to Azerbaijan's entry into the USSR as a ""Russian invasion"" and ""occupation."" The post interprets this statement as Baku considering Soviet actions illegal, implying that Azerbaijan should return territories of the Baku and Ganjin provinces to Russia and other parts to Georgia. The author suggests that Aliyev's statement undermines the legitimacy of his own rule and that of his father, labeling them as usurpers.

The post utilizes propaganda by selectively interpreting history and demonizing Azerbaijan.","USSR, Russia","–ê—Ä—Ö–∞–Ω–≥–µ–ª –°–ø–µ—Ü–Ω–∞–∑–∞ (PER), –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –∏–º–ø–µ—Ä–∏–∏ (LOC), –ê–∑–µ—Ä–±–∞–π–¥–∂–∞–Ω (LOC), –°–°–°–† (LOC), –ò–ª—å—Ö–∞–º –ê–ª–∏–µ–≤ (PER), –°–í–û (ORG), –ê–ª–∏–µ–≤ (PER), –í–°–£ (ORG), –£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω—É (LOC), –ê–∑–µ—Ä–±–∞–π–¥–∂–∞–Ω–∞ (LOC), –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ (LOC), –∞–∑–µ—Ä–±–∞–π–¥–∂–∞–Ω–∞ (LOC), –£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω—ã (LOC)","Azerbaijan (GPE), the first days (DATE), Ukraine (GPE), the Russian Empire (GPE), the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces (ORG), Archangel (NORP), the 20th century (DATE), Max (PERSON), Aliyev (PERSON), Russian (NORP), Ilham Aliyev (PERSON), Russia (GPE), USSR (GPE), Persians (NORP)","üí¨ Who will still protect Azerbaijan? üí¨\n\nIlham Aliyev called his invasion and supported the territorial integrity of Ukraine.\n\n""From the first days of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we supported the territorial integrity of Ukraine and continue to support it""\nÔªø\nHe also stated that the accession of Azerbaijan to the USSR was a ""Russian invasion and occupation.""\n\n‚ñ™Ô∏è History lessons from a kitchen historian are obtained.

The post implies a correlation between educational quality and socio-economic status, suggesting that children of elites receive superior education. It also mentions A. Revva, a critic of the SVO and Russia, as a former student of the elite gymnasium. The post points to systemic issues in Russian school funding and infrastructure, with the rural school lacking basic amenities and facing staff shortages.

Leonid Slutsky's call for standardized school funding is presented as a solution, aligning with a populist narrative of addressing regional disparities. The mention of A. Revva, a critic of the SVO, subtly links the elite with dissent, potentially aiming to discredit them.

Teachers there are also not simple - everyone is selected specifically for small offspring of stars. \n\nAnd now let's take a look at school in the outback (the last 3 photos), in which the future heroes of Russia, participants in their own: rickety walls, old furniture, and about convenient toilets, can only be dreamed of. Falling ceilings are the main feature of local life.

When falling, the drone exploded, which led to damage to the transformer and a temporary reduction in the power of one of the power units. Now the radiation background in the station and the surrounding area remains within the norm.\n\nAs a result of the explosion, a local fire arose, which was eliminated by fire calculations. According to preliminary data, there are no dead and injured among personnel of the station.\n\nBlock No. 3 of the Kursk NPP was unloaded by 50% to ensure safety. Currently, three power units operate at the station: power unit No. 3 operates in reduced power mode; power unit No. 4 is in planned repairs; power units No. 1 and No. 2 function in mode without generating electricity.\n\nThis is not the first attempt to strike at the Kursk NPP. In August 2024, the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova warned that such attacks by Ukrainian Nazis can lead to a large -scale technogenic disaster in Europe.

As Readovka found out, the best period for buying is the end of the year. The domestic car market is now experiencing ‚Äúdepression‚Äù, but despite this, car dealers are in no hurry to reduce prices. It will be possible to snatch the benefits in case of closing of dealerships - when they begin to sell the remains, making discounts on the car. For those who can wait, the best decision will be planned to buy in winter.\n\n‚ÄúReducing the price will go by the end of the year. When the dealers need to be re -offered, some of them will begin to sell their parks, ‚ÄùAuto Expert Konstantin Ligachev told about this in a conversation with Readovka.\n\nWhat definitely will not happen is a sharp rise in prices, since dealers understand that the market is not in the best position and only began to recover, the expert explained. But in winter, a decrease in demand for cars and possible discounts due to the need to sell stocks is quite likely. Sales of new cars in July jumped by 33.9% compared to the previous month, reaching 120 thousand units. The reason for the growth was the implementation of the delayed demand, a decrease in the key rate and avoiding savings - the Russians began to spend the accumulated more actively. A sharp increase in prices in this situation can only worsen the situation, and dealers understand this.\n\nüéâ Subscribe to Readovka in Max",,,,

This is a cafe, Tolstoy, the city of Kaliningrad, the Russian Empire, the far edge of the Russian land. What did we want to say? This man, a German citizen, Yasha Yansen, three children, bought an apartment here in Kaliningrad for a long time, works with money, all the Orthodox, brought the children here. The elder draws, wants to go to St. Petersburg, draws perfectly. The youngest was interviewed now in the Orthodox gymnasium, a Russian person. And today he was canceled a residence permit and gave 15 days to leave Russia. A man was born in Kazakhstan, the Motherland sent his parents to raise Solyan, I do not know, factories, something else. And never lived in Russia. Then they turned out to be the will of fate in Germany, because the mother is German, there is all that. They realized that this world is not for them and have been trying to return to Russia for many years. Four and a half years you are trying to get citizenship. There are all sorts of linings, pieces of paper, squiggles, dates, terms. And at some point, well, a step. Something was submitted not by the deadline, but pieces of paper were provided. Why not on time? Well, because in Sherkle. They go there to make money there, come here, live, build their apartment further, drive children back and forth. And maybe my great country, our indifferent society will have some kind of defender to intercede for this beautiful family that I love. Which is always here is a real patriot of Russia who wants to give his life and the life of his children here, in our field. Maybe there is some kind of intercessor. I call everyone. I don't know who. Postrykin Vladimir Vladimirovich and Mayakovsky, too, and comrade commander in chief, and all-all, I don‚Äôt know, Oleg Tsarev, someone. Yura Mezinov, if you hear me, let's get tired, let's not lose this Russian family. We must protect our people, save. A very large number of people, precisely because of bureaucratic delay from Europe who want to return home to Russia, they did not run away from Russia. These are people who came from the regions of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and all all sorts of other corners of our vast homeland, the Baltic states and so on. They cannot return. And these 90s were not needed by Russia. Let's be honest. Yes. And these people cannot return, because they come and receive the number in three weeks, and then they are told by a discharge in circles, you do not have that, this 5th, 10th. They leave, come, collect, come in a year again, through ... a new visa, new terms, and all this is extended, extended, and someday it bursts. But what is the matter? Maybe some kind of mechanism. We have personal petitions. If you need a guarantee, I am entrusted, maybe a personal, maybe property. Maybe we should introduce some kind of mechanism so that these people are with us. These are our people. Thank you. Let's support guys. Come on, please. Thank you all."

Therefore, today the first greeting word we want to share and support the welcoming word from the official page of the 1st Corps of NSU ""Azov"" with a fiery trident, which we carry in our hearts: \n\n""Glory to Ukraine!\n\nWhen these words say one, they are a dream. When they say a thousand, they become an idea. When they are spoken by a whole nation, it becomes independent.\n\nThere are thousands of peoples in the world, but not all of them have been able to gain their own independence today. It's not just about recognizing our borders by other countries. Independence is the concentrated will of the whole people to determine their future. An independent state is the most effective tool for providing this future. Non -independence peoples must buy their rights at a high price. They feed other people's armies and fight in foreign wars. Ukrainians remember this well, and therefore the best sons and daughters have been fighting for independence for centuries.\n\nIndependence of Ukraine did not emerge at the time of the emergence of the ""Declaration of Independence of Ukraine"" on August 24, 1991. Independence as a torch was conveyed by the dead - alive and the living - unborn. It broke out in Kiev in 1918, in Khust-in 1939, in Lviv-in 1941, in Kosmach-in 1944. Everywhere where Ukrainians could unite and fight for their rights. Independence for decades has been stored in camps and exile, in emigration and underground, and blood and sweat were shed for it. Finally, in 1991, it was restored, and the millennial history of Ukrainian statehood was completed.\n\nHaving proclaimed independence once - you cannot stop in development and fight. Of the thirty -four years of the existence of an independent Ukrainian state - one third was under the banner of the fight against the occupier. \nWe fight with an opponent who has many resources and does not spare them for our submission. And for the twelfth year, Ukrainians have been holding the system. The first and Second World Wars continued so much. But we fight for our independence, for our will, for our future, and while Ukrainians are united - we are not overcome. We have an example of the best, and today the best - in our benches.\n\nHeroes are glory!

I am here in the heart of Kiev, on Independence Square. And this is where it is best felt that independence is. Why it is so important to us. And why the Maidan is much larger than the country's main square. Because it is a symbol. Independence symbol. It is kept. This is a place where history is always created. The energy, the power of our people is born. At times when independence is at risk. And now, when there is a full -scale war for independence, it is here that on the Maidan, you can find such important symbols. Symbols of how we fight, what we fight for and how we overcome this war. These symbols around us. In this monument of independence. Inside it has a reinforced concrete frame and is really able to withstand a hurricane. So our Ukraine. She stood. Against the great disaster that Russia brought to our land. In this zero kilometer. This is the starting point of reference, where distances to Ukrainian cities are written. To our Donetsk, our Lugansk, our Crimea. And today these marks, they have a completely different meaning. They are not just about kilometers. They remind that all this is Ukraine. And there are our people. And no distance between us will change it. And no temporary occupation will change it. And one day this distance between Ukrainians will disappear. And we will be together again. As one family. As one country. And this is just a matter of time. And Ukraine believes that it can achieve it. Reach peace. Peace on all their land. Ukraine is capable of this. Because Ukraine is character. Stone endurance. View. A look that we do not take away. And hands burned by fire and time, but strong. Hands holding a shield. And protect their own. Your land. Your culture. Its millennial history. The proof of which is the founders of Kiev. And we protect our future. For which our characters gave life. The names we won't forget. –Ü –Ω–µ –∑—Ä–∞–¥–∏–º–æ. Names that defended independence. And it is here that on the Maidan, Ukrainians often say goodbye to the heroes on the shield. And anyone who was at this farewell at least once. And anyone who lost someone in this war has their own personal account for Russia forever. And he promised himself not to forget his characters. The embodiment of such an oath is a field of folk memory. The field of great power. Because in every small box someone is a great story, an act and a choice. Choice in favor of Ukraine. In favor of the future. Namely freedom in peace and peace in freedom. It is the philosophy that it reflects in our war. It reflects in our culture the image of the Cossack Mamai, who has gained freedom. Therefore, it can put weapons and take in the hands of kobza. Just in case, holding the saber close. But returning to a peaceful civilian life is what we all strive. And we know what no one will give. It can only be won. This is what we make 1278 days of this war. Wars for independence. For each of these days I want to thank you. Ukrainian warrior, Ukrainian volunteer, doctor, rescuer, teacher. Our youth, our parents, every Ukrainian and every Ukrainian. Thank you all for having passed. And for the Ukraine that we are with"

Fighting continues with both sides targeting energy infrastructure (Kremenchug and Novoshakhtinsky refineries). Russian forces are focused on the Donbass region, attempting to stretch Ukrainian defenses and break through fortifications. There are reports of manpower shortages within the Ukrainian Armed Forces, leading to reliance on mercenaries. Russia is reportedly prioritizing the depletion of Ukraine's military potential. Concerns are raised about political constraints hindering military actions, specifically regarding potential strikes near European borders. The post highlights ongoing challenges with air defense effectiveness and reports of exaggerated territorial gains.  Ukrainian forces maintain some offensive capabilities, particularly in naval areas.","Russian Armed Forces, Ukrainian Armed Forces, Kremenchug refinery, Novoshakhtinsky refinery, Donbass region, EU, US, NATO, Trump, Latin America, Druzhba oil pipeline, Sumi region, Black Sea","energy infrastructure attacks, russian offensive, ukrainian manpower shortages, military strategy, propaganda, air defense, negotiation stalemate","The post exhibits a strong pro-Russian bias, framing the conflict as a defense of Russia's national interests. It criticizes the EU and Ukraine for demands conflicting with those interests and portrays the US as prolonging the conflict through continued arms supplies. The post emphasizes Russian military successes and Ukrainian weaknesses, highlighting manpower shortages and reliance on mercenaries. There's a clear narrative of Russia's strategic advantage and a dismissal of Western involvement as detrimental to peace. The post subtly justifies potential military actions by framing them as necessary for achieving strategic goals, while simultaneously criticizing political constraints. The tone is nationalistic and presents a favorable view of Russian military strategy.","Russian military strategy, Russian Armed Forces, depletion of Ukrainian potential","–ï–≤—Ä–æ–ø—ã (LOC), –ì–ü–°–£ (ORG), –ö–∏–µ–≤ (LOC), –¢—Ä–∞–º–ø (PER), –î—Ä—É–∂–±–∞ (ORG), –í–°–£ (ORG), –ï–° (LOC), –ß—ë—Ä–Ω–æ–º –º–æ—Ä–µ (LOC), –ö–∏–µ–≤—É (LOC), –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ (LOC), –†–æ—Å—Å–∏—è (LOC), –£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω—ã (LOC), –ï–≤—Ä–æ–ø–∞ (LOC), –ù–ü–ó (ORG), –£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω—É (LOC), –ü–í–û (ORG), –ö—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω—á—É–≥—Å–∫–æ–º—É (PER), –ö–æ–Ω—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–µ (LOC), –°–í–û (ORG), –°–®–ê (LOC), –£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω–æ–π (LOC), –ï–≤—Ä–æ–ø—É (LOC), –í–° (ORG), –õ–∞—Ç–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π –ê–º–µ—Ä–∏–∫–∏ (LOC), –°—É–º—Å–∫–æ–π –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏ (LOC), –î–æ–Ω–±–∞—Å—Å–µ (LOC), –£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω–∞ (LOC), –ú–ò–î (ORG), –°–ú–ò (ORG), –ù–æ–≤–æ—à–∞—Ö—Ç–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–º—É –ù–ü–ó (ORG), –Æ–Ω–∞–∫–æ–≤–∫–∏ (LOC), –¢—Ä–∞–º–ø–∞ (PER)","The Armed Forces of Russia (ORG), the Armed Forces (ORG), Hungarian (NORP), the Armed Forces of Ukraine (ORG), Latin America (LOC), the Russian Foreign Ministry (ORG), Himars (NORP), Kyiv (GPE), Kremenchug (GPE), Trump (PERSON), European (NORP), Konstantinovsky (PERSON), The past week (DATE), Russia (GPE), Druzhba (FAC), American (NORP), EU (ORG), 17 thousand (CARDINAL), the morning of August 24 (TIME), Europe (LOC), Donbass (GPE), Ukrainian (NORP), zero (CARDINAL), the United States (GPE), Foreign Ministry (ORG), Novoshakhtinsky (GPE), Ukraine (GPE)","#Viewing #CREASE on the morning of August 24, 2025\n\n‚ñ™Ô∏è The past week was characterized by the next convergence of the negotiation track in boltology. The EU and Kyiv put forward requirements that are directly diverging with the national interests of Russia, for the defense of which they began their own. Sending to the post -war Ukrainian troops of the European countries is called an unacceptable plan for the Russian Foreign Ministry, and the issue of possible mutual territorial concessions when concluding peace, apparently, cannot be resolved by a diplomatic way. At the same time, the United States, with all the ostentatious ‚Äúpeacekeeping‚Äù of Trump, is ready to further supply weapons to Ukraine, however, now on more favorable conditions and through the gasket in the form of the EU, which will pay for it. \n\n‚ñ™Ô∏è Russia and Ukraine during the blows over the front line are busy destroying each other's energy capacities. The Armed Forces of Russia struck Kremenchug, and the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the Novoshakhtinsky refinery. At the same time, there is often no one‚Äôs owners of the enemy‚Äôs merits in the matter of the defeat of our refineries, since the organization of air defense is not subordinated to the purpose of protecting objects, but to fulfill the paper requirements of bureaucrats and headquarters. In this regard, in this regard, a misunderstanding of people familiar with the features of the arrangement of enemy drones, regarding the disconnections of the mobile Internet, the effectiveness of which is striving for zero. Another blow, by the way, designed to even more disturb Europe from Russia, was the arrivals of American Himars on the objects of the Druzhba oil pipeline. Hungarian decisive mumbled grumbled through their lips of their Foreign Ministry, but on this all questions to Kyiv ended.\n\n‚ñ™Ô∏è The army of Russia remains the only factor that objectively affects negotiations and the position of the parties in this process. Our troops continue offensive operations, concentrating the main efforts in the Donbass and pulling out reserves on other sections of the front. There is a plan for stretching the enemy forces according to LBS and creating conditions for breaking the fortifications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, on which there is not enough manpower. Judging by the fact that in a number of directions it is possible to send our sabotage and assault groups to the enemy ‚Äúbeyond the scruff‚Äù, the implementation of such plans is gradually carried out.\n\n‚ñ™Ô∏è The ‚Äúbeautiful reports‚Äù remain a problematic issue, which this time migrated to the Konstantinovsky direction. The fears of military bloggers regarding the inconsistency of realities with reports on the liberation of the villages were confirmed by officers from the front. This situation leads to the fact that some parts are not a united front, but deepening into the defense of the Armed Forces independently, repulsing the counterattacks from the flanks.\n\n‚ñ™Ô∏è In general, the strategy of our highest headquarters for the depletion of the military potential of the Armed Forces and Ukraine as such is clear. Messages of enemy media and officials about the constant outflow of the population, desertion of enemy soldiers of 17 thousand per month, an attempt to compensate for the lack of manpower by mercenaries from the countries of Latin America - everything speaks of the validity of the measures taken. At the same time, ‚Äúpolitical moments‚Äù, like likely subject explanations, are openly interfering with the set military goals",,,,

After the liberation of the White Mountain in the East and Katerinovka in the West, Russian troops continue the offensive in the north.\n\nüîª Hues have achieved successes?\n\n‚ñ™Ô∏è On the eastern flank of the RF Armed Forces are moving in the direction of the village of Mayskoye. Messages about the release of the RF Armed Forces to the village appeared even after the release of the Yar Chasov, but confirmations were received only now\n\n‚ñ™Ô∏è Once the battles in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe White Mountain were activated. Here, fighters of 4 OMSBR 1 SMB and other related units are fixed in Alexandro-Shultino with the support of UAV and artillery operators. According to the most optimistic data, the settlement has already been liberated by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. \n\nReliably, under the control of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, is half the village, and the enemy probably left the eastern part. Given the fact that between the village and Konstantinovskaya about five kilometers of unequipped fields, Ukrainian formations have to retreat immediately to the city.\n\n‚ñ™Ô∏è At the central site from the side of Katerinovka, divisions of 103 regiment 150 MSD occur. A supporting point was taken to the west of the village, which blocked the ways of safe departure of Ukrainian formations from the northern outskirts of Shcherbinovka. \n\n‚ñ™Ô∏è In the Shcherbinovka itself, the situation remains not completely clear: probably, the enemy led most of the units towards the non -elaboration to avoid the environment. Such a waste looks like a forced measure, given how many months before the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces, Russian attacks were restrained in the village.\n\nüìå Methodological advancement of Russian troops in this direction is another step towards taking the entire Konstantinsky agglomeration, which, as the Russian troops were successfully successful, will turn from a large fortified area into a ‚Äúfire bag‚Äù.\n\nIf you have additions on the situation, you want us to highlight the successes of your unit - you can always write to us in the feedback bot of \n@rybar_fedback_bot\n\nüìç High resolution card\n\nüìçenglish Version\n \nüìçonline cards are available by subscription to map.rybar.ru\n\n#digest #Russia #map #Konstantinovka #Ukraine\n‚úàÔ∏è Ru | ‚úàÔ∏è en | ‚úâÔ∏è Max\n\nüí∏ support us",,,,

The post also highlights the financial backing of pro-Western groups.","Gyumri, Armenia, 102nd base of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, Mother of Armenia, For the Republic, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Karabakh, Zangezur corridor, Russia","Pro-Russian protests, Geopolitical tensions in Armenia, Russian military presence, Propaganda, Counter-protest, Hybrid warfare","The post exhibits strong pro-Russian framing, portraying the 'Mother of Armenia' movement as patriotic defenders and the 'For the Republic' movement as provocateurs instigated by external forces.

Russian tactics involve small infantry groups infiltrating Ukrainian positions, exploiting gaps in defenses, and establishing positions within the forest. The area between Grigorivka and Dronivka is critical, as Russian forces could potentially cut off Ukrainian supply lines. Russian forces are also attempting to fully secure the Serebryansky Forestry and are making progress in the Zarichne settlement. The situation is described as unfavorable for Ukrainian forces, with difficulties in dislodging the enemy from the settlement.

Basically there are small groups of infantry that seep into the depths of the territory, exert constant pressure on the positions of Ukrainian fighters and look for any opportunity to hide for fixing. There are cases where the SUU positions are available only in the reports, and then the enemy suddenly finds himself in the rear at the positions of drones or already Rerivs, etc. \n\n‚öîÔ∏è The most difficult situation is currently in the forest on the northern bank of the Siverskyi River from Grigorivka to Dronivka, where the enemy can easily block the path in the latter, which will create adverse effects on the positions that are there. So we hope that they will be removed from there in time that they do not get into the environment. \n\nüá∑üá∫ At present, the enemy is trying to completely extract the Sou from the Serebryansky forestry and end the long -standing history of fighting for him. The enemy puts pressure in the direction of Yampol and was already fixed in the Yampil-Zaric road. In the most Zarichny, the situation is also unfavorable for Ukrainian fighters, as the opponent is gradually drawn into the settlement past the position and knocking them out from there. \n\nMapüõëblogg'S write to us","–°—ñ–≤–µ—Ä—Å—å–∫–∏–π –î–æ–Ω–µ—Ü—å (LOC), –°–û–£ (ORG), –î—Ä–æ–Ω—ñ–≤–∫–∏ (LOC), –ó–∞—Ä—ñ—á–Ω–æ–º—É (LOC), –°–µ—Ä–µ–±—Ä—è–Ω—Å—å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ª—ñ—Å–Ω–∏—Ü—Ç–≤–∞ (LOC), –ó–∞—Ä—ñ—á–Ω–µ (LOC), –°–µ—Ä–µ–±—Ä—è–Ω—Å—å–∫–æ–º—É –ª—ñ—Å–Ω–∏—Ü—Ç–≤—ñ (LOC), –ì—Ä–∏–≥–æ—Ä—ñ–≤–∫–∏ (LOC), –Ø–º–ø–æ–ª—è (LOC), –Ø–º–ø—ñ–ª—å (LOC)",,,

He is with us in the long -awaited moments of joy. He is with us at the time of the greatest grief. He is a memory. He is a story. It is a symbol. He is a victory. He is love. He is the future. He is nationality. He is the state. Happy Presidential Day. He is the flag of Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!"

The post presents a fact-check, debunking Szijj√°rt√≥'s arguments and framing the issue as Russian energy blackmail rather than a Ukrainian threat. The location of the pipeline in the Bryansk region of Russia is emphasized, clarifying it is not EU territory.

It accuses Szijj√°rt√≥ of spreading disinformation to protect Hungary's economic interests and deflect blame from Russia. The analysis highlights a political divide within the EU, with Hungary seemingly prioritizing cheap Russian oil over diversifying energy sources and supporting Ukraine. The post aims to discredit Szijj√°rt√≥'s claims and rally support for a stronger stance against Russian energy dependence. The narrative positions Ukraine as defending itself against Russian aggression and disrupting war financing, while portraying Hungary as complicit in supporting the Russian war effort.","Ukraine, European Commission (implied support for diversification), InformNapalm (self-promotion)",,"4 hours ago (TIME), Siarto (PERSON), Hungary (GPE), Croatia (GPE), Peter Siarto (PERSON), Hungarian (NORP), the Russian Federation (GPE), Bratislava (GPE), 2025 (DATE), European (NORP), Russian (NORP), Kiev (GPE), Kremlin (ORG), Cold War (EVENT), Brussels (GPE), Russia (GPE), Druzhba (FAC), Slovakia (GPE), Bryansk (GPE), EU (ORG), Poland (GPE), English (LANGUAGE), Friendship (FAC), EU Energy Security Protection (ORG), Moscow (GPE), Budapest (GPE), Brussels (ORG), The European Commission (ORG), the European Commission (ORG), Ukrainian (NORP), Ukraine (GPE)","4 hours ago, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Siarto in X published a tweet with an attached letter to the European Commission addressed to officials responsible for foreign policy and energy security.\n\nThis letter is an official complaint about Ukraine and the requirement for Brussels to put pressure on Kiev under the pretext of EU Energy Security Protection. We analyzed Siarto narratives and came to the conclusion that he selectively juggles with facts, trying to twist reality. This clearly reads his role as an instrument of information operation against Ukraine aimed at shifting emphasis: from Russia's aggressive war - to Ukraine's accusations of alleged ""threat to energy security"".\n\nIn response to this tweet, we prepared an English-language fact-chek traged\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Siarto claims that Ukraine ""threatens EU energy"", attacking the Druzhba oil pipeline.\nüìå Fact: ""Friendship"" is a Russian pipeline, a Cold War remnant and a Moscow blackmail tool. Hungary and Slovakia remain the largest buyers of Russian oil in the EU in 2025. It is a political choice, not inevitability.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Ukraine is cured into Russian assets that finance the war.\nüìå Every barrel coming through ""friendship"" fills the Russian military budget and pays missile strikes in Ukrainian cities. The real threat of the EU is Russian oil, not Ukraine's actions.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Siarto says, ""Without friendship is physically impossible.""\nüìå Lies. There are alternative routes through Croatia, Poland and other countries. They are more expensive, but most EU has already diversified supplies. Hungary and Slovakia deliberately delayed this process.\n\n4Ô∏è‚É£ ""Brussels is silent"".\nüìå The European Commission is obliged to protect the EU infrastructure. But ""Friendship"" in the Bryansk region is the territory of Russia, not the EU.

MOL, which has actually monopolized the refining in Hungary and Slovakia, continues to use exceptions, and the transition to alternative sources is towed.\n\nIf Orban continues to bet on ""Friendship"" with Moscow, then Ukraine has every right to consider the issue of cutting off the oil arteries of this ""friendship"". After all, cooperation with the aggressor is not only a moral degradation, but also a strategic economic trap for the Hungarians themselves. \n\nThat is why Magyar carefully reminded the Hungarians a historical phrase:\n\n""Ruszkik haza!""\n\nBecause the first step to the occupation of the country is pro -Russian politicians who first serve the Kremlin, because it is ""economically advantageous"" for their wallets, and then gradually pass the entire country of the enemy. \n\nThe Hungarians can be good neighbors for Ukrainians if their leaders stop making a fifth column for Russia from Hungary and remember that their real allies are Europeans, not Russians. \n\nAnd all pro -Russian political puppets are best placed on the door, remembering 1956 and the phrase:\n\n""Ruszkik haza!"".","–£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∞ (LOC), –†–æ—Å—ñ—ó (LOC), –£–≥–æ—Ä—â–∏–Ω—ñ (LOC), –°–ª–æ–≤–∞—á—á–∏–Ω—ñ (LOC), –ö—Ä–µ–º–ª—å (LOC), –ü—É—Ç—ñ–Ω–∞ (PER), –£–≥–æ—Ä—â–∏–Ω–∞ (LOC), –î—Ä—É–∂–±–∏ (LOC), –û—Ä–±–∞–Ω (PER), –Ñ–° (ORG), –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—ñ (LOC), –ú–∞–¥—è—Ä (PER), –£–≥–æ—Ä—â–∏–Ω–∏ (LOC), MOL (ORG), –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–æ—é (LOC), –Ñ–° (LOC), –°—ñ–π—è—Ä—Ç–æ (PER)",,,

The message suggests a pattern of limited, probing attacks rather than a large-scale offensive.","Stepnogorsk, Kamyanske, Kakhovka reservoir, Sou, Russian forces, Ukrainian forces, Katsap","Russian offensive, Ukrainian defense, Frontline battle, Military tactics, Propaganda, Kakhovka reservoir, Stepnogorsk, Kamyanske","The message exhibits strong Ukrainian nationalist sentiment, framing the conflict as a defense of Ukrainian territory against Russian aggression. The use of the derogatory term 'katsap' for Russian soldiers demonstrates a clear dehumanization of the enemy. The message aims to bolster morale by highlighting Ukrainian military successes and portraying Russian attempts as futile. The focus on Russian casualties and failed incursions serves as propaganda to demonstrate the effectiveness of Ukrainian defenses. The message implicitly appeals for continued support by showcasing the ongoing struggle and the need to counter Russian advances. There is a clear narrative of Ukrainian resilience and determination in the face of Russian aggression.","Sou, Ukrainian forces, Ukrainian defense, Effectiveness of Ukrainian strikes",,"Primorsky (GPE), many hours (TIME), Map (PERSON), Plavni (GPE), West (GPE), Sou (PRODUCT), Sou (LOC), the last few weeks (DATE), Kamiansky (GPE), zero (CARDINAL), Katsaps (NORP), blogg (PERSON), Kamyansky (PERSON), Stepnogorsk (GPE), Kakhovka (GPE)","üá∑üá∫ The enemy continues to exert pressure on Stepnogorsk \n\nüõëThe pictures you can see the approximate number of fixations of the enemy's lesions in the last few weeks, which demonstrate the nature of attempts to reach Stepnogorsk. Immediately after the admiration of Kamyansky, the enemy tried to hastily continue the development of his success in the direction of Stepnogorsk, trying to climb landings and fields. The blue zone shows the initial successful attempts of the katsap, but the Fighters of the Sou, in particular, from among the pilots and storms multiplied these attempts by zero. \n\nüèπ Recently, the enemy has switched more attention to the settlement of Plavni and attempts to reach the village of West. It is better to get into the depth of the territory, because this is facilitated by a dense building in which you can hide, fix and accumulate for further promotion. Sometimes it is possible to reach even the private construction of Primorsky, but the katsaps live there for a long time.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Katsaps also use the ability to climb into the rear on the Kakhovka reservoir, which gradually turns into a floodplain, which is also worth paying attention. Of course, there are some cases of continuation of assault actions from the northern part of Kamiansky by plantings and fields, but they are more like many hours of creeps in the cloak, which end with the equally lesions from the pilots of the Sou. Recently, the enemy was recorded in the central part of Stepnogorsk in the number of several people who managed to leak into the village, but they were quickly liquidated. \n\nMapüõëblogg'S write to us","–ö–∞—Ö–æ–≤—Å—å–∫–æ–º—É –≤–æ–¥–æ—Å—Ö–æ–≤–∏—â—É (LOC), –°–û–£ (ORG), –°—Ç–µ–ø–Ω–æ–≥—ñ—Ä—Å—å–∫–∞ (LOC), –ö–∞–º'—è–Ω—Å—å–∫–æ–≥–æ (LOC), –ü–ª–∞–≤–Ω—ñ (LOC), –°—Ç–µ–ø–Ω–æ–≥—ñ—Ä—Å—å–∫ (LOC), –ü—Ä–∏–º–æ—Ä—Å—å–∫–æ–≥–æ (LOC)",,,

The CEC of Moldova will open only two polling stations for approximately 350,000 registered voters in Russia, despite legal limitations of 5,000 ballots per station. The post alleges that the Moldovan government, under President Maia Sandu, is deliberately limiting voting access for the Russian diaspora while increasing access for the Western diaspora, potentially to manipulate election results. Polling stations in Transnistria have also been reduced compared to previous elections. The post frames this as a deliberate attempt to disenfranchise certain voters and influence the election outcome.","Maia Sandu, Moldovan Central Election Commission (CEC), Russia, Moldova, Transnistria, European Union (EU), Moldovan Diaspora, 2024 Presidential Elections, Parliamentary Elections","Election Interference, Diaspora Politics, Moldovan Politics, Transnistria, Voting Rights, Propaganda, Disinformation","The post exhibits strong anti-Sandu sentiment and portrays her regime as authoritarian and manipulative. It frames the situation as a deliberate attempt to suppress the voice of the Moldovan diaspora in Russia, implying a bias towards Western interests. The narrative aligns with common Russian information operations aimed at destabilizing neighboring countries by exploiting internal divisions and portraying governments as illegitimate. The post leverages the issue of voting rights to fuel discontent and potentially incite further protests.

It highlights a statement from Iran's UN representative denying official involvement in threats against Grossi. The post suggests the reports could be used to justify increased Western pressure on Iran or provide a pretext for Israeli military action against Tehran.

It frames Western media reports as disinformation and portrays Iran as a victim of a smear campaign. The narrative aligns with Russian geopolitical interests by undermining Western credibility and potentially justifying Iranian actions. The post subtly supports Iran by downplaying any official involvement in threats against Grossi and suggesting external actors are manipulating the situation. The framing of potential Israeli attacks as opportunistic and driven by external pressure reinforces a common Russian narrative.

And in this regard, the question arises what role in such raids can play the countries of the Baltic states. Starts from the territory of these countries are extremely unlikely. Why? Well, because NATO will not go to such an association at the moment. Moreover, far -painted drones are fixed at the time of starting. The problem of their advance detection and knocking down in the vast territory of Russia, which is extremely difficult to close. And in principle, it is extremely extremely difficult to completely close. But the Baltic states plays another important role. The countries of the region provide Ukraine with the necessary intelligence, thanks to the presence of the NATO PRP unit in the border Russian regions. At the same time, there is also a high probability that some UAVs can fly through NATO countries. In Estonia, the Ukrainian drone fell. Everyone knows about it. And no one talks about it. But in our yellowing press 100% will say how. That this is a flight error or a pilot's curvature. But the entry on our ports and bases from the Baltic cannot be excluded. And this will be possible only when using the Baltic states. In addition, in this zone under the cover of the Baltic Air Policing mission, the alliance regularly involves the reconnaissance. To identify our air defense and radar positions. Thanks to the Armed Forces of Ukraine, there are current routes for their UAVs. To be continued..."

It was in the settlement ***. We were asked to help the forces who were in positions at that time. We were not snipers, that is, there was a job, there were positions. We went there somewhere in a week or even before all those events and worked there with the boys. Our position remained extremely and, say, came into the thickening of these events. The enemy went to us almost into the rear. They came out of the Nevadsk. They came directly to us. Before the assault, as I said, we were very active in attacking the enemy fipe. And firing arts so that even the heads could not be raised. And as soon as they stopped doing so, I went on a teammate. And there was from their position literally 30-40, if I'm not mistaken. And they quickly gave up trenches. I raised our whole group and people who were familiar. From adjacent units. He wakes me up, he says that the suburban is already in our trenches. I say how so? He says, so, get together quickly. And in fact I had to clean the trenches that. And it is in such a situation. Because we did not have to wait for help or some reinforcement or additional information. Because everything was solved for minutes. And it was necessary to act. Because the subjugation was just in the middle of the trenches, which was long enough. And at the other end of the trenches were our brothers. We started cleaning. Initially, the grenades were thrown by those participants that we did not see. And then with the shooters, they rolled along the trenches. And so we got to our contrary. When we cleaned, the operations passed that the etheri of the drones were flying. We went all the moments in the overlap. But they were open from two sides. And we got aired drone. One of the spans near us was there. My brother tells me, live after him. I say, I don't know. Because it was still unclear at first. But then he made herself alive after him. Everything is Okay. The finale is over. We are alive, healthy. Our group did its job and came out. We stopped panic. They said that there was a need to work nowhere. And they went. You can say that even the boys were raised. A little bit, you can say that the boys who lost their self -control took over the overgrowth. We have not seen that you can work, you can not beat. Simply, the clerks took their positions. And they helped us in promotion. As we did not know what we could, if anything, we were covered behind. Are you standing standing again? Yes."

Here you emphasized all this absolutely correctly, noticed. Creative people, they are in their own extraordinary personalities, quite complicated. And when in such a small room as a dugout, such an accumulation of this energy, here, of course, everyone wants to prove themselves. And creative and the characters of everyone, let's say, are different. And, of course, the grinding was, honestly, it was difficult. It was difficult for us. But our business trips are quite frequent. I already have this fourth business trip. They are long from two weeks. Month and a half. But this trip is for almost six months. We came here in May. When we leave, it is still unknown. Well, we cope with this task. Music tied us up. She unites us. And always adults. The conditions here, you understand, are difficult. And there is no more capricious here. Just no opportunity or time. We must understand that anything can happen. And you have to help each other. So all your ambitions are to hell."

The bill mandates non-alternative prison sentences of 5 to 10 years for disobedience to orders, with no possibility for the court to issue a lighter sentence or probation. The post highlights the potential negative consequences of this bill, including the risk of unjust sentences, demoralization of the military, and a return to Soviet-era repression tactics.

This raises concerns about a return to Soviet-era repression and potential for unjust sentencing. Military personnel and volunteers criticize the bill, arguing discipline should be based on trust and effective command, not fear. The message highlights the risk of demoralization, internal conflicts, and undermining combat effectiveness. It suggests the bill could be exploited by Russia to further destabilize the Ukrainian Armed Forces.","Bill No. 13452, Verkhovna Rada, Ukrainian Criminal Code, Ukrainian Armed Forces, Russia, Soviet Union, Military Personnel, Volunteers","Ukrainian Legislation, Military Discipline, Criminal Justice, Russian Information Warfare, Soviet Repression, Military Morale, Political Criticism","The message expresses strong criticism of the proposed legislation, framing it as a regressive step that could harm military morale and discipline. The author suggests the bill is either a result of a lack of understanding or a deliberate attempt to weaken the Ukrainian Armed Forces, potentially benefiting Russia. The sentiment is overwhelmingly negative towards the bill and its potential consequences. The message appeals to nationalistic sentiments by highlighting the sacrifices of Ukrainian soldiers and warning against policies that could undermine their effectiveness. The framing of the bill as a return to Soviet repression is a deliberate attempt to evoke negative associations and mobilize opposition.","Volunteers, Military Personnel",,"The Verkhovna Rada (ORG), 10 years (DATE), the Bill No. 13452 (LAW), the Criminal Code (LAW), 5 to 10 years (DATE), Article 75 of the Criminal Code (LAW), Bill No. 13452 (LAW), Soviet (NORP), the Armed Forces (ORG)","The Verkhovna Rada registered the Bill No. 13452, which dramatically strengthens the punishment for the military for ""disobedience"".\n\nWhat are the deputies offered:\n\nThey propose amendments to the Criminal Code and provide for disobedience to the commander of a non -alternative punishment from 5 to 10 years in prison. The court will not be able to assign a softer sentence or terms.\n\nThe bill also supplements Article 75 of the Criminal Code, including ""disobedience"" to the list of actions for which the probationary period cannot be applied. In addition, deputies want to limit the possibility of release of military and from administrative responsibility, in particular - even for careless damage to military property, etc.\n\nWhat does this mean:\nIn fact, it is proposed to return to Soviet repression, where individual circumstances are not taken into account, and the military can receive 10 years in prisons even in a situation where the order was deliberately wrong or criminal.\n\nThe reaction of military and volunteers:\n\nThe initiative has already caused acute criticism. The military emphasizes that discipline should be based on trust, mutual responsibility and effective command, not on the fear of punishment. Volunteers warn that instead of strengthening the army, such steps create risks of internal confrontation and demoralization.\n\nWhy is it dangerous:\n\n- In real combat conditions, the situation is different, and ""disobedience"" can be forced or justified.\n\n- lack of flexibility in the right of court means the risk of automatic unfair sentences.\n\n- It can reduce combat capability and confidence in the commanders and the state.\n\nAt the same time, society expects deputies completely different - increasing responsibility for corruption, for abuse of the rear, not to create repressive norms for military people who are already fighting for the country and risking life and health.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBill No. 13452 in its current form is a step back that will not contribute to the improvement of discipline, but will create the preconditions for abuse of office and serious internal consequences in the Armed Forces.\nThe initiators of the law either do not understand this or consciously go to the creation of such prerequisites that can be considered as ""useful idiots"" in favor of the aggressor.","–í–µ—Ä—Ö–æ–≤–Ω—ñ–π –†–∞–¥—ñ (ORG), –ó–±—Ä–æ–π–Ω–∏—Ö —Å–∏–ª–∞—Ö (ORG)",,,

This sparked a reaction in Uzbekistan, with ex-deputy Rasul Kusherbaev launching a flash mob with the hashtag '#–º—ã–Ω–µ—Ä–∞–±—ã' ('We are not slaves'). The post highlights the exploitation of this incident for anti-Russian propaganda by Uzbek media and figures like filmmaker Ravshan Narbaev, known for content promoting criminal activity. Notably, the post contrasts this with an instance of a Russian soldier rescuing a wounded Uzbek comrade near Toreck, Ukraine, suggesting a discrepancy between official narratives and on-the-ground cooperation. The incident is framed as an example of rising xenophobia in Russia due to migration issues.","Rasul Kusherbaev, Ravshan Narbaev, Podmoskovie, Toreck, #–º—ã–Ω–µ—Ä–∞–±—ã, Russian Constitution, DTM, Maria Zakharova, Uzbekistan, Russia, Ukraine","Xenophobia in Russia, Anti-Russian Propaganda, Hybrid Warfare, Russo-Uzbek Relations, Migration Issues, Disinformation Campaign, War in Ukraine (contextual)","The post reveals a complex interplay of internal Russian issues (xenophobia, migration) and external relations with Uzbekistan. It suggests a deliberate effort by certain Uzbek political actors to exploit a localized incident for anti-Russian propaganda, potentially fueled by existing tensions or external influences. The post criticizes Uzbek nationalists for selectively highlighting negative incidents while ignoring positive examples of Russo-Uzbek cooperation, particularly in the context of the war in Ukraine. This points to a broader pattern of disinformation and the use of social media for hybrid warfare, aimed at damaging relations between Russia and Uzbekistan.","Russian soldier, Russo-Uzbek cooperation","–†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ (LOC), –†–∞—Å—É–ª –ö—É—à–µ—Ä–±–∞–µ–≤ (PER), –†–æ—Å—Å–∏—è (LOC), –£–∑–±–µ–∫–∏—Å—Ç–∞–Ω (LOC), Instagram (ORG), –°–ú–ò (ORG), –£–∑–±–µ–∫–∏—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–µ (LOC), –†–æ—Å—Å–∏—é (LOC), –ú–∞—Ä–∏—é –ó–∞—Ö–∞—Ä–æ–≤—É (PER), –†–∞–≤—à–∞–Ω –ù–∞—Ä–±–∞–µ–≤ (PER), –ü–æ–¥–º–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤—å–µ (LOC), –£–∑–±–µ–∫–∏—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∞ (LOC)","DTM (ORG), Ravshan Narbaev (PERSON), anti -Russian campaign (NORP), more than 3 km (QUANTITY), third (ORDINAL), Uzbeks (NORP), Uzbek (NORP), Russophobes (NORP), first (ORDINAL), last year (DATE), Toretsk (GPE), the other day (DATE), Russia (GPE), Rasul Kusherbaev (PERSON), Max (PERSON), Ru (PERSON), the Ministry of Ecology (ORG), Russians (NORP), Russian (NORP), Constitution (LAW), Uzbekistan (GPE), Maria Zakharova (PERSON), Today (DATE)","üìù PIP on bonesüìù\nThe Uzbek politician earns points.\n\nColleagues with DTM raised an important question in the context of a recent incident with the Uzbek taxi driver in the suburbs. Recall that the other day, a citizen of Russia (Russian by nationality) shouted on a taxi driver, calling him a ‚ÄúRussian slave‚Äù.\n\nThe situation itself does not surprise, since against the backdrop of migration problems in Russia, the level of xenophobia to the newspaper ‚Äúforeign specialists‚Äù has obviously increased, many of whom annoy the indigenous population of Russia.\n\nHowever, such statements by a Russian citizen contradict the Constitution, for which the assessment from law enforcement agencies will clearly follow. However, it is more interesting to use this situation in Uzbekistan.\n\nüîª What happened?\n\n‚ñ™Ô∏è None of Rasul Kusherbaev-ex-deputy of the parliament, and now an adviser in the Ministry of Ecology (in general, a third-rate politician), who last year actively demanded to include Maria Zakharova in the list of ‚Äúunwanted citizens‚Äù, launched a flash mob.\n\n‚ñ™Ô∏è In his Instagram page, he posted the post with the hashtag ""We are not slaves."" This message is now actively distributed by various media of Uzbekistan, and nationalist publications are especially promoting this.\n\n‚ñ™Ô∏è The first of this anti -Russian campaign was supported by the director Ravshan Narbaev, who shot a film about Uzbek terrorists who promote criminal life, racket, robberies, that is, what they are actively fighting in Russia.\n\n‚ñ™Ô∏èThe more than that, some Uzbeks who live ‚Äúin high‚Äù in Russia began to hunt a guy with a video, threatening him with reprisals. Moreover, they do it openly, not afraid of persecution.\nüñç School is noteworthy in that the Uzbek Russophobes very quickly took advantage of the video that appeared on the network, although derogatory words to Russia and Russians have repeatedly sounded from the same nation.\n\n‚ùóÔ∏èThis is such a story when the wounded Russian fighter carried a colleague from Uzbekistan more than 3 km in the Toretsk region, Uzbek politicians and the media were not even mentioned. Why? Because such stories paint Russia and friendship with it, but Russophobes do not need this.

Multimodal Summary**\n\nThe Telegram post discusses a threat made by **Ilya Shestakov**, the head of Russia's Federal Agency for Fishery (Rosrybolovstvo), against Norway. Shestakov warned that if Norway does not revise its position within a month, Russia will close its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) to Norwegian fishing vessels and adjust fishing quotas in the Barents and Norwegian Seas to align with Russian national interests.\n\nThe post frames this as a response to Norwegian sanctions against two Murmansk-based fishing companies, **Norebo** and **Murman Sofud**, which have restricted their access to Norwegian ports, fishing rights, and frozen their assets.\n\nThe author criticizes Norway for its financial support of Ukraine, citing **$8.4 billion in aid for 2026** (with additional funding since 2022). The post claims this money funds ""enemy drones"" that attack Russian civilians and supports ""sabotage and terrorist attacks"" in Russia. It also accuses Norway of benefiting from the sabotage of the **Nord Stream pipelines**.\n\nThe post questions why Russia has not taken retaliatory measures earlier and suggests that the current threat is a delayed response to Norwegian actions.\n\n---\n\n### **2.

The post frames this as a response to Norwegian support for Ukraine, specifically citing $8.4 billion in aid and alleging that this funding supports drones used in attacks on Russian civilians and contributes to sabotage. The post also accuses Norway of benefiting from the Nord Stream pipeline sabotage. This demonstrates a pattern of linking economic actions to perceived security threats and utilizing disinformation to justify retaliatory measures.","Ilya Shestakov, Rosrybolovstvo, Norebo, Murman Sofud, Norway, Ukraine, Barents Sea, Norwegian Sea, Nord Stream, Russia","Economic Coercion, Sanctions, Russian Nationalism, Ukraine Aid, Nord Stream Sabotage, Hybrid Warfare, Disinformation","The post exhibits strong nationalist sentiment, framing the situation as a defense of Russian national interests against foreign aggression. It portrays Norway as an adversary aligned with Ukraine and the West, actively supporting actions harmful to Russia. The narrative relies heavily on emotional appeals, linking Norwegian aid to civilian casualties and accusing the country of benefiting from sabotage. The post also demonstrates a delayed response to perceived grievances, questioning why countermeasures were not implemented earlier. This suggests a deliberate strategy of escalating tensions and leveraging economic tools for political gain.

For example, the same issue with peacekeepers has been discussing for more than a year, but the Western countries have not yet approached the decision that would satisfy everyone.\n\nüö© It is more funny that the White House promised to provide intelligence so -called Ukrainian. FT is written as if it were something unthinkable, but the Americans have been transmitting information to the Ukrainian authorities since 2014, and with the beginning their coordination has only intensified.\n\nüè≥Ô∏è RQ-4B drones flying in Crimea do this for a reason.

The soldier recounts a near miss with a mortar shell and describes using small arms to disable the drone. The post serves as a recruitment tool for the ""Somalia"" battalion, providing contact information and a motivational slogan. The incident highlights the use of both conventional and drone warfare tactics in the conflict.","Chip, Somalia Battalion, Malinovka, Baba Yaga, Omsbsomali@yandex.ru, Somali-bat.ru, vk.com/omsbsomali","combat experience, drone warfare, recruitment, propaganda, Russian military, Malinovka, Somalia Battalion","The post is a clear example of Russian propaganda aimed at bolstering morale, glorifying military service, and encouraging recruitment. It frames the conflict as a heroic struggle, emphasizing the resilience and patriotism of Russian soldiers. The use of a personal story and a lighthearted quote (""think about the weather"") attempts to humanize the conflict and downplay its brutality. The post promotes a nationalist narrative and implicitly demonizes Ukrainian forces by referring to their drone as ""Baba Yaga"".

My call sign chip. I am the attack aircraft of the legendary subdivision of Somalia, which I am very proud of. The best fighters are brought up here. I have been serving since March of the month of this year, that is, not so long ago, six months already. Chip, tell us about your last combat exit. Well, the output was so spectacular, so to speak. It was the village of Malinovka. We stopped there with a group on a motorcycle, when we were driving along the dam, and machine guns worked on two sides. We drove into the house, after which a mortar shell flies in just a couple of minutes later. It does not break, going into the basement. We wanted to leave this house, because they are coming to it. Kamikadze arrives at him immediately at the door. On the same day, we drove with him. We drove with him, we drove with him. We drove with him, we drove with him. The ceiling was huge, and looking at it, I saw that the lobby was flying. And when I heard this sound, and seeing it, I say to my partner, jump out the window. We abruptly jumped from the second floor to the window, into the bushes. And lying in the bushes, we watch how this shell falls into the house, and does not break either. And we gave it to shoot at it. Literally three shots, her battery lights up, she begins to plan with such sound that we won. After some time, just grabbing the machine gun, I scream my partner, Krasav, a bro, with the words, and run into the forest. We run into the forest, there we dig and wait for mortar arrivals. After which everything calmed down. Well, after two or three hours I told my partner that you can‚Äôt stay here, let's go find some kind of shelter house. Well, they found the house, went there, there were Ukrainian things, the military, there were their provisions, all that was. Well, we expected them to come, they were, as it were, on the defense, they waited for them, perhaps you never know. And I ruled the glasses with a finger to see if there is dust. Well, that is, recently they were or for a long time. I watch dust, so there were a long time, okay, that's all. Well, the night spent the night, everything, I think, okay, in the backpack we have food there, we must go to take the backpack from the house where, when Baba Yaga arrived. Everything, the partner stayed there, I went to the neighboring house, I came to the house before that I went into it, climbed, and that I see that it is my RD-lice, and this is the unexplored shell, which Baba Yaga thrown off. I, what to do, well, I need to pick up the RD-shka. I took this shell like this, gently shifted on the sidelines without unnecessary actions, took the RD-lush and drove from there, from this house. Well, nevertheless, everything went well. Do you have any of your personal techniques that help maintain composure? Well, in short, I had such a advice from the kid, he, he says, Max, you don‚Äôt bother, think about the weather, just think about the weather, always says when you go, think about the weather. Listen, what thoughts visit you most often? Most often, well, probably, these are thoughts about the house. All the same, there is some kind of longing, about relatives, friends, I still miss. Like they miss, they are proud of me. I think these thoughts."

Telegram post discusses the problems faced by the Russian rocket and space corporation ""Energia."" The article by the general director, Igor Maltsev, highlights issues such as debts, high interest on loans, delays in projects, and loss of motivation among employees. The post acknowledges that these problems have been ongoing for a long time and are openly discussed within the enterprise. It identifies both objective factors, such as delays in the creation of the ""Orel"" spacecraft due to issues with adjacent components and the gradual refusal of foreigners from places on ""Soyuz"" missions, and man-made factors, such as failures with the ""Perseus"" acceleration unit and the loss of commercial satellites for Angola and Egypt. The post concludes that while the corporation is unlikely to be closed due to its significance, the only way to avoid further decline is through state orders, concentration of forces, and a clear understanding of the state's needs in manned cosmonautics.\n\n### **Topic Modeling**\n\n1. **Corporate Problems**: Discussion of the financial and motivational issues within the rocket and space corporation ""Energia.""\n2. **Space Industry**: Analysis of the delays and challenges in the space industry, particularly with the ""Orel"" spacecraft and ""Perseus"" acceleration unit.\n3. **Geopolitical Factors**: Impact of geopolitical factors on the space industry, including the refusal of foreigners from ""Soyuz"" missions.\n4. **State Intervention**: The need for state intervention and clear directives to address the problems within the corporation.\n\n### **OSINT Analysis**\n\nThe post provides an in-depth analysis of the problems faced by the rocket and space corporation ""Energia.""

It aims to expose systemic cooperation and lack of accountability. The post implicitly criticizes Poland for allowing its companies to facilitate these transactions and calls for greater transparency and control. The tone is accusatory and seeks to highlight the hypocrisy of 'deep concern' without concrete action. It also attempts to differentiate between supportive populations within those countries and the actions of their companies/politicians.","People of Poland, People of Hungary, People of Slovakia, Supporters of Ukraine",,"Poland (GPE), only one (CARDINAL), Novicbank (ORG), 2014-2021 (DATE), Slovakia (GPE), Putin (PERSON), Great War (EVENT), the Russian Federation (GPE), Militant Intelligence (ORG), third (ORDINAL), the Companies of the Russian Security Service (ORG), the Ministry of Defense of Macedonia (ORG), Hundreds of thousands and millions of euros (MONEY), MIC (ORG), Russia (GPE), hundreds of thousands of euros (MONEY), 2 (CARDINAL), Rostechu (ORG), WZL # 1 (FAC), years (DATE), two (CARDINAL), 2015 (DATE), Commerzbank AG (ORG), Mi-24 (PRODUCT), Angel Falls (LOC), March 2016 (DATE), 543 690 EUR (MONEY), NATO (ORG), Macedonia (GPE), 543 690 euros (MONEY), EU (ORG), Russian (NORP), the Informnampalm International Intelligence Community (ORG), Germany (GPE), Polish (NORP), European (NORP), Ukraine (GPE), Hungary (GPE), 08.06.2016 certifies (DATE), Polit-Elektronik (ORG), 70 % (PERCENT), Frankfurt am Main (GPE), 1 (CARDINAL), the Russian Security Service (ORG), #OHRD (LAW), 2014 (DATE), Today (DATE)","üôÜÔ∏è Documents from the Russian MIC are flowing like water from Angel Falls ...\n\nüî• In the framework of the #OHRD operation, the Informnampalm International Intelligence Community, together with the Militant Intelligence volunteers, continue to obtain and analyze the internal documents of the Companies of the Russian Security Service.

This means that even after the 2014 sanctions, the Russian MIC continued to use the European financial system for international military agreements.\n\nüî• Document 2. Mi-24 repair letter for Macedonia.\n\nIn March 2016, Polit-Elektronik sent a letter to the ""helicopter of Russia"", where she agreed on the schedule of supply of blades Mi-24 of the Ministry of Defense of Macedonia. State Polish A aircraft repair plants WZL # 1 also participated in the process.\n\nThis shows that Poland (NATO member) and Russia (under sanctions) coordinated military projects for a third country. The Polish company was in fact a mediator who helped the Russian MIC to enter international tenders.\n\nThese two documents supplement previous publications and demonstrate the systemic cooperation of Polish structures with the Russian defense complex after 2014. Such agreements provided the Russian Federation with currency infusions and helped to strengthen the military-industrial complex for further aggressive wars.\n\nIn fact, every euro, which came into the ""helicopters of Russia"" and other structures of the Russian Security Service of Ukraine after 2014, was turned into rockets and sprains, which were later beat in Ukraine. The lack of effective sanctions and punishment for aggression of 2014-2021 gave Putin the opportunity to accumulate strength for a new Great War.\n\nConclusion\n\nHundreds of thousands and millions of euros with NATO countries have been in Russian MIC for years. Without this help, Putin would be more difficult to prepare for a full -scale invasion.\n\nEuropean society has the right to know how companies from EU and NATO have helped the Russian aggressor. Only transparency and control will allow to avoid repetition of such schemes in the future.\n\nAt the same time, we are grateful to people from Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and other countries that have sincerely supported and support Ukraine.

Has happened, many of my loved ones, friends, acquaintances gathered and went. I could support them only by SMS, some moral, strong-willed messages, that, they say, guys, keep everything. And he himself understood what he also wanted, but since I myself am a musician by education, not quite military, I did not fit a little. And before the signing of the contract, I did this that I went here, to the zone, with concerts, with the guys. That is, if earlier, I had to, roughly speaking, to take vacation pay, sick leave, inventing something in my main job. That is, you took a vacation and voluntarily came? Yes, yes. That is, in order to come here, at work they still have not been released, because there was work. And it turned out that I had to come up with some kind of sick leave, vacation pay. And take at your own expense to come here, to the boys, to come with some concerts. We also invented three people there, such ideological ones. And all, and we went here, came. And then unexpectedly, by chance, apparently, God is the judge and the witness that it was in the engineering troops, there is also a familiar among me, the chief of engineering troops, he came up with a gathering of all professionals. Gather one. The ideological ensemble."

I then worked on the Black Label Stain. Then there was such a show of songs on TNT. Different groups, soloists came there, prove themselves, show themselves and continue their career. In fact, we did not communicate in the next year, but I was signed on him. In Telegram, he periodically looked after his children. Multiple '. He played in the Commissioned Monate.

Many people ask me when everything will end there. But then it will end when everyone will rise. When we all unite. Get up, Russian people. Get into battle, for a mortal battle. Get up in battle.

And Vladyka, of course, knew what we are doing, where we are working. This is before ... the 24th year, of course, so much has already been completed here, experienced. And the help of hundreds of tons is taken here. And Vladyka Eugene comes up to me and converts the envelope. He says, so, Seraphim, you know what and where to direct. And I just have one thing in my thoughts now. First of all, I have to make a person a body armor because he goes to a very dangerous combat mission. We return from Yekaterinburg to Moscow. Immediately, the body armor is already waiting for me, I ordered. On the same day I go to Solidar and transfer it to Acra. It was simply uncomfortable to move in it, because we move with a fairly large equipment. And since we are a shock group, we transfer ... we constantly transfer to ourselves up to 80-100 kilograms of all kinds of equipment and equipment. Father Seraphim found out that I have no additional protection. I wanted to make life easier for me so that it was much more comfortable for me, it‚Äôs more convenient to move. He found out about this, took a pause and literally a day before reaching the position under our task, they brought me a body armor. The body armor was with his shoulders. The neck is closed.

The post highlights the political obstruction of Ukraine's EU accession by Hungary, Slovakia, and certain Polish politicians, framing them as aligned with Russian interests. The reference to historical events like Katyn and Smolensk serves to emphasize the perceived hypocrisy of these relationships.

Prior to the attack, increased NATO reconnaissance activity was observed, including RQ-4B, R-8A, CL-650, and E-3F aircraft. The post suggests a two-pronged Ukrainian strategy: depleting Russian air defenses with drones, followed by missile strikes. Preparations for the attack included positioning landing boats near the Danube River and deploying GUR special groups to the Odessa region. The message frames the event as a predictable escalation following a period of anticipation.","Ukrainian Armed Forces (VSU), GUR (Main Directorate of Intelligence), Odessa region, Sevastopol, Saki, Danube River, RQ-4B aircraft, R-8A aircraft, CL-650 aircraft, E-3F aircraft, Russia, Ukraine, NATO","drone warfare, NATO reconnaissance, military preparedness, air defense, Ukrainian offensive, Black Sea region, Russian military posture","The message presents a narrative of Ukrainian aggression and NATO involvement, potentially aimed at bolstering support for Russian military actions. The emphasis on NATO reconnaissance activity serves to portray Ukraine as a proxy in a larger geopolitical conflict. The framing of the attack as a predictable escalation suggests a justification for Russian preparedness and potential counter-offensives. The message utilizes a tone of detached observation ('In general, we observe') which may be intended to project an image of calm and control despite the ongoing attacks.

Russia is actively targeting Azerbaijani diaspora structures and businesses through deportations, arrests, and economic pressure, while Azerbaijan responds with media campaigns, symbolic actions (demolishing monuments), and rhetoric. Russia has also conducted strikes on SOCAR oil depots in Ukraine. Despite diplomatic efforts, the conflict shows no signs of de-escalation. Russia appears to be escalating its response with more direct actions, while Azerbaijan relies on propaganda and symbolic gestures.

Russia's actions against the Azerbaijani diaspora suggest an attempt to destabilize Azerbaijan internally and punish it for its foreign policy. Azerbaijan's response is largely symbolic and propagandistic, indicating a lack of equivalent leverage. The rhetoric employed by both sides is increasingly hostile, with President Aliyev framing Azerbaijan's entry into the USSR as an 'occupation'.

In parallel with this, the RF Armed Forces struck the SOCAR oil depot on the territory of the so -called Ukraine.\n\n‚ñ™Ô∏è This background took place at the official level - negotiations of diplomats and signing a document on economic cooperation, but they did not change the general vector of the conflict.\n\nüñçAzerbaijani side builds its strategy around propaganda and symbolic steps. The demolition of monuments, media campaigns, statements of parliamentarians and diasporas show a course on demonstrative Russophobia. At the same time, real steps come down only to threats and information attacks.\n\nüö© Russian authorities are in place of local actions. The deportations and arrests of the leaders of the Azerbaijani diasporas, fixing violations in foreign supplies, and punishment for the sympathizing with Azerbaijan Person are consistently. The culmination was blows to SOCAR objects in the territory of the so -called Ukraine, which clearly showed the transition to more stringent pressure tools.\n\nüè≥Ô∏è Despite recently signed agreements in the economic sector and negotiations of foreign ministers, there is no talk of normalizing relations. Especially against the background of the statement of President Aliyev, who called the entry of Azerbaijan into the USSR ‚Äúoccupation‚Äù and ‚ÄúRussian invasion‚Äù. \n\nüìå The balance in this situation is obvious: Azerbaijan has fewer exposure levers, so it concentrates in information wars and demonstrative actions. Russia, although not in full force, but began to use real measures that can affect its Caspian counterpart.\n\n‚ùóÔ∏è This difference forms the prospect of the crisis - either the authorities in Baku will come to terms with reality, or continue escalation in rhetoric, not possible",,,,

Following this, Colombia and Argentina recognized the ‚ÄúCartel de Los Solos‚Äù with a terrorist group. The US intelligence services believe that this powerful criminal organization consists of officers of the Venezuela National Guard and is directly related to the country's political leadership.\n\nSimilar statements and diplomatic steps occur against the background of the movement of the American naval group to the banks of Venezuela.

At the same time, today there were reports of the captivity of several Operators of UAV from the composition of 60 OMBR of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces at once, which suggests a relatively deep breakthrough of defense on the site.\n\n‚ñ™Ô∏è The offensive of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and in Zarechny, where the advanced assault groups, according to preliminary data, have already reached the western outskirts of the settlement, while the eastern ones are already fixed. From the southern outskirts of Torsky, the enemy is also almost completely knocked out. \n\nüìå In addition, the successes of the RF Armed Forces in Serebryansk forestry are gradually confirmed, the situation for the Armed Forces of Ukraine is significantly deteriorating.

The source is the Russian Telegram channel RVvoenkor, known for pro-Russian reporting. The statement originated from a Fox News interview. This suggests a deliberate effort to highlight a perceived division within Western policy regarding sanctions against Russia. The channel's framing emphasizes the 'leverage' aspect, potentially aiming to undermine Western unity and portray the U.S. as willing to negotiate on terms favorable to Russia.","Janet Yellen, Fox News, Russian Assets, Vladimir Putin, United States, Russia, RVvoenkor","Economic Sanctions, Geopolitical Negotiations, Frozen Russian Assets, U.S.-Russia Relations, Propaganda, Media Influence","The post serves to reinforce a narrative within Russia that the West is divided on the issue of sanctions and that the U.S. is open to negotiation. This can be used to bolster domestic support for the Russian government and to justify its actions in Ukraine. The framing of Yellen's statement as a strategic move, rather than a punitive measure, is likely intended to reduce internal criticism of the Russian government and to portray the West as pragmatic rather than hostile. The source, RVvoenkor, is a known pro-Russian channel, indicating a clear bias in the reporting.","Negotiations with Putin, Frozen Russian Assets (as leverage)","–°–®–ê (LOC), Fox News (ORG), –ë–µ—Å—Å–µ–Ω—Ç (PER), –ü—É—Ç–∏–Ω—ã–º (PER)","Fox News (ORG), Russian (NORP), United States (GPE), one (CARDINAL), Putin (PERSON)","‚Äº Ô∏è The United States Finance Minister opposed the immediate confiscation of Russian assets\n\n‚ûñ ‚ÄúAs for frozen Russian assets: I think this is part of the negotiations with Putin.

However, given the activity of the US and NATO intelligence aviation, massive raids should still be expected. Also, the goals of the enemy were the Afipsky refinery in the Krasnodar Territory and Novokuybyshevsky Oil Refinery in the Samara Region, frames with fires from places diverge. The records shows that our mobile firing groups were again located directly at the facilities, and the rare shooting of our means of defeat, if it led to hits on the target, then the inertia of the movement of Ukrainian drones would still lead to their fall into factories. In the Rostov region in the village of Mankovo-Kalitvin fragments of the UAV fell onto the roof of the house and damaged the wiring. The house for two owners is de -energized. Due to the threat of detonation of the warhead, stuck in the roof, it was necessary to evacuate the inhabitants of this and 50 neighboring private houses - only 89 people, including children.\n\n‚ñ™Ô∏è In the Belgorod region in the new Tavolzhanka, the APU Dron detonated the household in the courtyard, the man received a mine-explosive injury, blind fragmentation injuries of his back and legs. In the village of the Twalloi Valuysky District, the FPV-drone struck a car, one man died on the spot, the driver himself reached the hospital. Also under the blows of Moore, wet Orlovka, Chapaevsky, Nechaevka, Belovskoye, Bessonovka, Leonovka, Urazovo, Swedeswan, Resipykhka. \n\n‚ñ™Ô∏è in the Sumy direction - battles in Yunakovka and at Bessalovka.\n\n‚ñ™Ô∏è In the Krasnoliman direction, Russian troops advance in the Borovskaya Andreevka, Karpovka and Shandrivlovo area, as well as in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Torsky and Serebryansk Forestry.\n\n‚ñ™Ô∏è In the Konstantinovsky direction there are fights by Katerinovka, Shcherbinovka, in the Aleksandro-Shultino area, north of the village of Dyleevka. According to enemy channels, ours try to go to Kleban-by-by-Bake reservoir.\n\n‚ñ™Ô∏è In the Pokrovsky (Red Army) direction of the Armed Forces of Russia, they will storm in the successful and in Kotlino, the battles for which have been going on for many months. The Russian Ministry of Defense announced the liberation of May 1, located south of Pokrovsk.\n\n‚ñ™Ô∏è On the Zaporizhzhya Front on the Stepnogorsk section, there are heavy offensive battles.

A very beautiful idea. Yes, well, in general, this center is still not only nourishing, but also accompanies our legendary general, Hero of Russia. He is here with us today, we had the opportunity to communicate. It is not even important that he himself is a passionary, but that he was around him all these years, even when I served, already knew who Sergei Ivanovich was. And then years have passed, nothing has changed. Sergei Ivanovich is in service, around professionals, people who know the nuances, specifics of battle, war, rules. And this center we understand that we must further upgrade. Because what happened at the beginning. Probably, it was enough, but now not. And the requests are fair. And we will look for opportunities to implement a bench shooting as soon as possible, which is useful today, and the hangar in order to conduct BPL competitions, let's call them this way. And everything related to the specifics of the capture of a particular fortified area, the supporting path. This is also all on purpose, it should be real. You understand this perfectly. And I just want to say that we, being in a civil position, also understand this. Because it is a concern. This is not to play. This is in order to be prepared. And in order to return home, to the family, to his hometown, to his favorite suburbs and continue to do good deeds. That's why. Thank you, Andrey Yuryevich."

There are no overt signs of propaganda or disinformation, but the selective reporting of the new rules could be seen as a way to frame the narrative.",,,"today (DATE), first (ORDINAL), Ukraine (GPE), 18 to 22 (DATE), 18 to 22 years (DATE), Ukrainian (NORP), Cabinet (ORG), 18-22 (DATE)",‚ùóÔ∏èColovik ages of 18-22 have already begun to be released from Ukraine-SPSU \n\nUkraine online | Sign,"Ukraine (LOC), –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∞ (LOC), –î–ü–°–£ (ORG), –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏ (LOC)",uk," —Å–∏—Ç—É–∞—Ü—ñ—é –Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–ø—É—Å–∫–Ω–∏—Ö –ø—É–Ω–∫—Ç–∞—Ö. –ß–∏ –≤—ñ–¥—á—É–ª–∏ –≤–∏ —Ç–µ, —â–æ –ø–æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∞ –ö–∞–±–º—ñ–Ω—É –ø—Ä–æ –≤–∏—ó–∑–¥ –∑–∞ –∫–æ—Ä–¥–æ–Ω —á–æ–ª–æ–≤—ñ–∫—ñ–≤ —ñ –∂—ñ–Ω–æ–∫-–¥–µ–ø—É—Ç–∞—Ç–æ–∫ –Ω–∞–±—É–ª–∞ —á–∏–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—ñ –≤—ñ–¥ —Å—å–æ–≥–æ–¥–Ω—ñ? –ß–∏ —î –≤–∂–µ –∑–±—ñ–ª—å—à–µ–Ω–Ω—è –∫—ñ–ª—å–∫–æ—Å—Ç—ñ –æ—Ö–æ—á–∏—Ö –ø–µ—Ä–µ—Ç–Ω—É—Ç–∏ –ø—É–Ω–∫—Ç–∏ –ø—Ä–æ–ø—É—Å–∫—É? –î–∞–≤–∞–π—Ç–µ —Ç—Ä—ñ—à–∫–∏ —Ä–æ–∑–º–µ–∂—É—î–º–æ, –±–æ –∑–º—ñ–Ω–∏ –¥–æ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª –ø–µ—Ä–µ—Ç–∏–Ω—É –∫–æ—Ä–¥–æ–Ω—É, —è–∫—ñ —Å—Ç–æ—Å—É—é—Ç—å—Å—è —á–æ–ª–æ–≤—ñ–∫—ñ–≤ —É –≤—ñ—Ü—ñ –≤—ñ–¥ 18 –¥–æ 22 —Ä–æ–∫—ñ–≤ –≤–∫–ª—é—á–Ω–æ, –≤–æ–Ω–∏ –æ–ø—É–±–ª—ñ–∫–æ–≤–∞–Ω—ñ –≤ —É—Ä—è–¥–æ–≤–æ–º—É –∫—É—Ä'—î—Ä—ñ —ñ —Ñ–∞–∫—Ç–∏—á–Ω–æ –Ω–∞–±—Ä–∞–ª–∏ —á–∏–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—ñ —ñ –ø—Ä–∏–∫–æ—Ä–¥–æ–Ω–Ω–∏–∫–∏ —ó—Ö –≤–∂–µ –ø–æ—á–∞–ª–∏ –∑–∞—Å—Ç–æ—Å–æ–≤—É–≤–∞—Ç–∏ –Ω–∞ –∫–æ—Ä–¥–æ–Ω—ñ –≤—ñ–¥ —Å—å–æ–≥–æ–¥–Ω—ñ. –í–ª–∞—Å–Ω–µ, –∑–º—ñ–Ω–∏, —è–∫—ñ —Å—Ç–æ—Å—É—é—Ç—å—Å—è –∂—ñ–Ω–æ–∫-–¥–µ–ø—É—Ç–∞—Ç–æ–∫, –º–∏ –æ—á—ñ–∫—É—î–º–æ –Ω–∞ –æ–ø—Ä–∏–ª—é–¥–Ω–µ–Ω–Ω—è —Ü–∏—Ö –∑–º—ñ–Ω, –Ω–∞ –Ω–∞–±—Ä–∞–Ω–Ω—è —á–∏–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—ñ —ñ, –∑–≤—ñ—Å–Ω–æ, –∫–æ–ª–∏ —Ü–µ —Å—Ç–∞–Ω–µ—Ç—å—Å—è, –ø—Ä–∏–∫–æ—Ä–¥–æ–Ω–Ω–∏–∫–∏ —Ç–∞–∫–æ–∂ –∑–∞–±–µ–∑–ø–µ—á–∞—Ç—å –º–æ–∂–ª–∏–≤—ñ—Å—Ç—å –ø–µ—Ä–µ—Ç–∏–Ω—É –∫–æ—Ä–¥–æ–Ω—É —Ü—ñ—î—ó –∫–∞—Ç–µ–≥–æ—Ä—ñ—ó –≥—Ä–æ–º–∞–¥—è–Ω –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏ –≤—ñ–¥–ø–æ–≤—ñ–¥–Ω–æ –¥–æ —Ç–∏—Ö —É–º–æ–≤, —è–∫—ñ –±—É–¥—É—Ç—å –ø—Ä–æ–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω—ñ, –≤–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω—ñ –≤ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª–∞ –ø–µ—Ä–µ—Ç–∏–Ω—É –∫–æ—Ä–¥–æ–Ω—É. –ì—Ä–æ–º–∞–¥—è–Ω–∞–º–∏ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏. –í—ñ–¥–Ω–æ—Å–Ω–æ —á–æ–ª–æ–≤—ñ–∫—ñ–≤, —è–∫ —è –≤–∂–µ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–≤, —â–æ –≤—ñ–¥ —Å—å–æ–≥–æ–¥–Ω—ñ —Ü—è –Ω–æ—Ä–º–∞ –∑–∞–ø—Ä–∞—Ü—é–≤–∞–ª–∞ —ñ –≤–∂–µ –ø—Ä–∏–∫–æ—Ä–¥–æ–Ω–Ω–∏–∫–∏ –º–∞—é—Ç—å –ø–µ—Ä—à–∏—Ö –±–∞–∂–∞—é—á–∏—Ö –ø–µ—Ä–µ—Ç–Ω—É—Ç–∏ –∫–æ—Ä–¥–æ–Ω, —Ö—Ç–æ—Å—å –Ω–∞–≤—ñ—Ç—å –≤–∂–µ –≤—Å—Ç–∏–≥ –æ—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∏—Ç–∏—Å—è –≤ –ø—É–Ω–∫—Ç–∞—Ö –ø—Ä–æ–ø—É—Å–∫—É —ñ –≤–∏—ó—Ö–∞—Ç–∏ –∑–∞ –º–µ–∂—ñ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏. –ù–∞–≥–∞–¥–∞—é, —â–æ –∑–Ω–æ–≤—É –∂ —Ç–∞–∫–∏, —Ü–µ —Å—Ç–æ—Å—É—î—Ç—å—Å—è —â–µ —Ä–∞–∑ –≥—Ä–æ–º–∞–¥—è–Ω –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏, —á–æ–ª–æ–≤—ñ–∫—ñ–≤ —É –≤—ñ—Ü—ñ –≤—ñ–¥ 18 —Ä–æ–∫—ñ–≤ –¥–æ 22 —Ä–æ–∫—ñ–≤ –≤–∫–ª—é—á–Ω–æ.","The situation at checkpoints. Have you felt that the Cabinet resolution on traveling abroad men and women's deputation has come into force today? Is there an increase in the number of people who want to cross the checkpoints? Let's distinguish a little, because changes to the rules of border crossing, which concerns men aged 18 to 22, they are published in a government courier and actually entered into force and border guards have already started applying on the border from today. Actually, the changes that relate to women's deputies, we expect to publish these changes, to enter into force, and, of course, when it happens, the border guards will also provide the possibility of crossing the border of this category of Ukrainian citizens in accordance with the conditions that will be registered, inscribed in the rules of crossing the border. Citizens of Ukraine. With regard to men, as I said that from today this norm has worked and already border guards have the first to cross the border, someone has even had time to take place at checkpoints and go outside Ukraine. Let me remind you that again, this applies to Ukrainian citizens, men aged 18 to 22 years inclusive."

Let's distinguish a little, because changes to the rules of border crossing, which concerns men aged 18 to 22, they are published in a government courier and actually entered into force and border guards have already started applying on the border from today. Actually, the changes that relate to women's deputies, we expect to publish these changes, to enter into force, and, of course, when it happens, the border guards will also provide the possibility of crossing the border of this category of Ukrainian citizens in accordance with the conditions that will be registered, inscribed in the rules of crossing the border.

With regard to men, as I said that from today this norm has worked and already border guards have the first to cross the border, someone has even had time to take place at checkpoints and go outside Ukraine.
